#About the Framework
Cucumber is an open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Assertions and HTML reports are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.

There's also a cross-platform stand-alone executable for teams not comfortable with Java. We don't have to compile code. Just write tests in a simple, readable syntax - carefully designed for HTTP, JSON, GraphQL and XML. And we can mix API and UI test-automation within the same test script.

A Java API also exists for those who prefer to programmatically integrate cucumber rich automation and data-assertion capabilities.
